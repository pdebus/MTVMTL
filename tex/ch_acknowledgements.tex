\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Dr. Philipp Grohs and to Markus Sprecher for the very interesting
topic in the intersection of differential geometry, numerical analysis and software engineering
I was permitted to work on in my thesis and for their support and guidance during the writing of this thesis.\\

I am especially indebted to Markus Sprecher for his extraordinary good supervision, commitment and uncountably many helpful
comments and explanations. It was a pleasure working with and next to him and I would like to thank him also for many
interesting discussions.\\

Furthermore, I would like to thank Günter and Angelika Höhlein for proofreading and valuable comments on style and
structure.\\

Lastly, I would like to thank my girlfriend Luzia and my family for their continuous support and encouragement throughout my 
whole studies.
