	abstract = {Most denoising and enhancement methods for color images have been formulated on linear color models, namely, the channel-by-channel model and vectorial model. In this paper, we study the total variation (TV) restoration based on the two nonlinear (or nonflat) color models: the chromaticity--brightness model and hue--saturation--value model. These models are known to be closer to human perception. Recent works on the variational/PDE method for nonflat features by several authors enable us to denoise the chromaticity and hue components directly. We present both the mathematical theory and digital implementation for the \{TV\} method. Comparison to the traditional \{TV\} restorations based on linear color models is made through various experiments. },

@article{Perona,
	abstract = {{Diffusions are useful for image processing and computer vision because they provide a convenient way of smoothing noisy data, analyzing images at multiple scales, and enhancing discontinuities. A number of diffusions of image brightness have been defined and studied so far; they may be applied to scalar and vector-valued quantities that are naturally associated with intervals of either the real line, or other flat manifolds. Some quantities of interest in computer vision, and other areas of engineering that deal with images, are defined on curved manifolds; typical examples are orientation and hue that are defined on the circle. Generalizing brightness diffusions to orientation is not straightforward, especially in the case where a discrete implementation is sought. An example of what may go wrong is presented. A method is proposed to define diffusions of orientation-like quantities. First a definition in the continuum is discussed, then a discrete orientation diffusion is proposed. The behavior of such diffusions is explored both analytically and experimentally. It is shown how such orientation diffusions contain a nonlinearity that is reminiscent of edge-process and anisotropic diffusion. A number of open questions are proposed}},

	abstract = {{We study here a classical image denoising technique introduced by L. Rudin and S. Osher a few years ago, namely the constrained minimization of the total variation (TV) of the image. First, we give results of existence and uniqueness and prove the link between the constrained minimization problem and the minimization of an associated Lagrangian functional. Then we describe a relaxation method for computing the solution, and give a proof of convergence. After this, we explain why the TV-based model is well suited to the recovery of some images and not of others. We eventually propose an alternative approach whose purpose is to handle the minimization of the minimum of several convex functionals. We propose for instance a variant of the original TV minimization problem that handles correctly some situations where TV fails.}},

@article{Sato2014,
	abstract = {
This article deals with the Grassmann manifold as a submanifold of the matrix Euclidean space, that is, as the set of all orthogonal projection matrices of constant rank, and sets up several optimization algorithms in terms of such matrices. Interest will center on the steepest descent and Newton’s methods together with applications to matrix eigenvalue problems. It is shown that Newton’s equation in the proposed Newton’s method applied to the Rayleigh quotient minimization problem takes the form of a Lyapunov equation, for which an existing efficient algorithm can be applied, and thereby the present Newton’s method works efficiently. It is also shown that in case of degenerate eigenvalues the optimal solutions form a submanifold diffeomorphic to a Grassmann manifold of lower dimension. Furthermore, to generate globally converging sequences, this article provides a hybrid method composed of the steepest descent and Newton’s methods on the Grassmann manifold together with convergence analysis.
